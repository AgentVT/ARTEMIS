### Background Readings:
- [Is Iron Man jarvis still a fiction?]("https://medium.com/@froger_mcs/iron-mans-jarvis-is-it-still-a-fiction-972c337294de")
- [Two Indian Men create Jarvis OS]("https://www.indianweb2.com/2014/07/28/two-indians-made-iron-mans-jarvis-ai-reality/")
- [Mark Zunckerberg's blog on Jarvis]("https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10103347273888091/?pnref=story")
- [An in-depth analysis of Jarvis by a professional]("https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-studying-ai-ruins-marvel-movies-you-tony-starks-jarvis-feroli/")

__NOTE:  _In the initial stage the project will be limited to the software part_.__
Some points:
- First goal would be to create a weak AI.<br>
[Here's a quick read about Weak Vs Strong A.I.]("https://e3zine.com/strong-artificial-intelligence/")<br>
- Although some of the features described below would seem overblown but they actually exists. The challenge here is to integrate the individual features and modules.
<br>
