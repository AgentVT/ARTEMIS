### Background Readings:
- [Is Iron Man jarvis still a fiction?]("https://medium.com/@froger_mcs/iron-mans-jarvis-is-it-still-a-fiction-972c337294de")
- [Two Indian Men create Jarvis OS]("https://www.indianweb2.com/2014/07/28/two-indians-made-iron-mans-jarvis-ai-reality/")
- [Mark Zunckerberg's blog on Jarvis]("https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10103347273888091/?pnref=story")
- [An in-depth analysis of Jarvis by a professional]("https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-studying-ai-ruins-marvel-movies-you-tony-starks-jarvis-feroli/")

__NOTE:  _In the initial stage the project will be limited to the software part_.__
Some points:
- First goal would be to create a weak AI.<br>
[Here's a quick read about Weak Vs Strong A.I.]("https://e3zine.com/strong-artificial-intelligence/")<br>
- Although some of the features described below would seem overblown but they actually exists. The challenge here is to integrate the individual features and modules.
<br>

### This project structure is proposed as follows:
  - #### Hardware
    - ##### RFID scanner
    - ##### IoT

### How to start working :
- Fork the repository
- Clone it
- Work on it
- pull changes
- push the code
- Submit pull requests

### How to get it running:
- Clone it
- open terminal in linux based system or git bash in windows
- navigate to the directory
- command: bash install_requirements.sh

### NOTE to contributors:
_Use Python3 for development_
- Currently the features are built and tested in windows environment so some of the features may not work on other platforms
- Pls try to add the missing feature for the platform you are using
- Try to write clean code with comments and descriptive variable names
- Divide the work into small modules
- Update the install_requirements.sh and requirements.txt files as and when required
- Feel free to improvise this README
- Commit as frequently as possible
